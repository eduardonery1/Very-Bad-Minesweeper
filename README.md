# Very-Bad-Minesweeper
This is a very bad implementation of the classic minesweeper game that I did in a hour cuz why not? It fails in design, style and efficiency

### Run the script
### Say your name
### set your chosen coordinates in a range of 0 to 8 in the x and y axis
### if its a 0 it will run a BFS to show all conected 0s
### if its a bomb it will just say Game Ovah and end
### else it will say how many near bombs there are
